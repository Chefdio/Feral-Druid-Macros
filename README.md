# Feral-Druid-Macros
  Chefdio1 hour ago Hello and thank you for your time by doing this. I was using the macros you actually had there for my druid and everything worked fine till the last update and the macro stop working. I had the command on my icon but was not working. I still have one for the mage : #showtooltip /click DB_Fire But for my druid, after I deleted all the macros and installed again, I copy and paste the name after I put the macro in my notepad and save it and close the file, then I copy the name and paste it on the new macro using macro toolkit  and after /reload ui and even restarting the game, nothing show on the macro icon. The name it's there but like the example above  and here it's again below (#showtooltip /click DB_Fire) Nothing appears and I have no way to make it work. Can you please tell me what I'm doing wrong here? I DL all the addons you asked to DL and even just installed also the old fashion Gnomesequencer and nothing happen. I wish I could just fix that as it was last week when it was working perfectly. I also try to pay you with pay pal and the website was unable to do this private, I'm willing to pay you for your time btw. I don't mind at all, if you help me to fix this and understant why such thing happen, so I will know what to do in the future.
